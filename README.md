This website is a spin-off of Medium.com. Medium for Mediums is a site for mediums (psychics) to get together and mingle with other mediums and anyone else who might appear. 

This project was created by Christopher Breen, Nathan Treadaway, Jesse Brooks and myself. 

Medium for Mediums is a full-stack project and was built using Express on the backend and Pug on the frontend. We use RESTful conventions for our API calls and followed Medium.com's lead when making functionality dynamic (Follow and Like buttons, posting comments, etc).
