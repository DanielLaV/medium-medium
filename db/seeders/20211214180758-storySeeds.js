          title: "So You Want to be a Professional Psychic",
          content: `you’ve been doing Tarot for your girlfriends and they tell you you’re great and you are feeling confident that when you throw a spread you’re seeing something
        and it is not just random stuff . . . you actually “see it”
        or you’ve been interested in the paranormal or psychic shows on TV and you’ve been reading and meditating and think this is something you might like (somehow) to do
        or you’ve read every book you can get your hands on about astrology and are doing charts for Lady Gaga and Cardi B and Puff the Wonder Penguin and feel as if you know your stuff
        you’re ready to put it out there, hang your shingle, start making money doing what you love
        where oh where do you begin?
        well, I am going to answer that . . . first off, being “good” is a prerequisite
        when you are doing things for free for the girls in your dorm, then everything you say is exciting and earth shattering
        when people are paying you, then it’s different
        and you have to understand this difference, what the expectations are of the people paying you and HOW those expectations are going to mess with your mind
        before you can get very far
        actually, I think this is THE hurdle for most young psychics or readers; what happens when there are expectations that you’re going to deliver the goods
        so, not only are you well advised to practice your craft, you are also well advised to look at yourself and your self-esteem
        because issues with your self-esteem are going to get magnified, a lot and super quickly
        once you start
        but if this hasn’t scared you off, then hop on, Psychic World Crazy Train, all aboard !!
        another important point: not everyone who says Namaste, Love and Light etc etc etc
        is a “nice person” or is actually happy to see you when you show up, all fresh faced and eager
        there is an old school Mean Girls vibe that runs wild through the psychic community and this, too, is another hurdle you have to move past
        there are gatekeepers and my advice is to be prepared so you’re not sad when you figure this out
        and just rock out with your chakra out anyway
        and keep moving forward
        sometime in the next week or so, I will get down into the weeds a bit and give you some tips and tricks about how to get clients, how to develop your “brand”, how to monetize your gifts
        web sites, PayPal, blogtalk radio, that kind of stuff
        but, for Day One, here is what you need to know first
        do it because you love it, do it because you love people, do it because it is who you are
        I have been wildly successful (at times) and a hott mess train wreck at other times . . . national TV, voted (once) the #5 Best Psychic Reader in the World, etc etc etc
        some of this was “luck” (but, really, who is calling the shots on luck, anyway), some of it determination to understand myself, some of it a desire to test myself
        I am guessing many of you feel the same as me
        you get good at it because you love it and the “profession” (I promise) will make you question, from time to time, why you care and why you continue to do it
        however, it is an amazing life and one unlike any other
        and if you feel the call, for sure, you need to answer it !!
        but, these first words of advice from an old man who has been there, done it all (pretty much) and lived to tell the tale
        are, first, make sure it is something you care about
        fakes don’t last, nor should they
        two, make sure it is something you’re actually “good at”
        and, three, make sure you can handle rejection and pressure
        if I haven’t scared you off (yet), then stay tuned
        tomorrow, we will talk about logistics
        where to go and what to do once you get there
        wishing you ALL love and great success ❤`,

          title: `7 Ways To Tell if Someone was in Your Past Life, According to Psychics`,
          content: `I got a request back in 2018 from one of the editors from Bustle for some info on past lives they published in an article entitled 7 Ways To Tell if Someone was in Your Past Life, According to Psychics and I was one of the psychics they consulted. I am re-posting my response for my particular piece of the article below.
        Here are the Questions:
        1. What’s the deal with past lives? What’s the biggest misconception?
        2. How can you tell if anyone in your current life has been in a past life with you?
        People reincarnate because, in spite of news by many to the contrary, they like to “be here”. Past lives are not unique; everyone has past lives. We will reincarnate looking, acting, thinking, and “processing” much as we did before. What actually “reincarnates” is an emotional template . . . so when you think of “karma”, the way in which karmic influences get kicked off is through the emotional REACTION of an individual to a situation. Change how you react — EVOLVE . . . and you change your world.
        One of the biggest misconceptions about reincarnation is the notion of karma as an eye for an eye kind of payback. It is not that simplistic; we evolve emotionally and grow through seeing with new eyes but if you shot me in 1862, I am not, specifically, coming back to shoot you in 2018.
        Another misconception is the idea that we change quite drastically from one lifetime to the next. For there to be “reincarnation” there has to be some unique quality reincarnating !! Think of each incarnation as the soul’s personal expression of self, sort of like the soul’s personal art project. But each go round, we come with similar traits, talents, and quirks, as well as consistent physical qualities, regardless of race or gender — because you are going to be BOTH male and female somewhere along the way . . . that are echoes of our dominant “soul essence”.
        We can see past life connections very clearly through Astrology. There is a branch of Astrology called synastry which is the comparison of two or more birth charts, typically used when looking for the romantic possibilities between two prospective partners but, of course, most people don’t have birth charts to compare (or any idea about how to compare them !!) so a better rule of them is that people in your “soul group” will typically cause a “reaction” — doesn’t matter, so much, good or bad. But you can’t be neutral about people with past life “entanglements”. We really DO know our (past life) tribe by their vibe. So, you feel them . . . deep down.`,

          title: `Powerful: 15 Facts That Make Mew Scary AF`,
          content: `At first glance, Mew is a small, adorable Pokémon who loves to play with both trainers and other creatures. This tiny creature is a fan favorite among children who love its playful nature. Though Mew may charm you with its large eyes and cat-like aloofness, it's easy to misjudge this Psychic-type Pokémon.

        Some may expect Mew to be cowardly since it usually stays hidden or a weakling because to most it would appear it's running away. However, Mew is an ancient Pokémon and has witnessed the evolution of its species over time and Mew enjoys observing on the sidelines. Most Pokémon are more than willing to jump into battle, even without the command of their trainer. Mew takes a more cautious approach by gauging the enemies' abilities. Mew is so powerful that it knows to take a more tactical approach to battles.

        Mew is proof that powerful things can come in small packages. Most expect its clone, Mewtwo, to be more deadly, so Mew's abilities are easy to underestimate and take less seriously like other cute Pokémon. When things get serious, Mew reveals itself to be a powerful comrade or enemy. Once obtained, which isn't easy, Mew is an incredibly versatile ally to add to your Pokédex. #15: Spawned A Powerful Failed Clone: The Pokémon series has many characters that look cute, but are more powerful than expected. Though Mew is the prime example of adorable powerhouses, another Pokémon, Ditto, shares Mew's deceiving looks. Both Ditto and Mew are powerful because they have similar DNA. Ditto has the powerful ability to transform into any Pokémon. Ditto is also genderless and can also breed with any Pokémon. They also share almost identical normal and shiny variant colors, while both Pokémon share the same weight of 8.8 pounds.

        Though Ditto can transform into almost any Pokémon, it has a few flaws, unlike Mew. Ditto is unable to learn any disc moves, such as TMs or HMs. The Pokémon it transforms into also shares Ditto's facial characteristics of small eyes and a wide smile.`,

          title: `The Story Long Island Medium Doesn’t Want You To Know`,
          content: `Theresa Caputo has captivated audiences as the Long Island Medium since her show of the same name first began airing on TLC in 2012. According to Caputo, she has the ability to channel the spirits of those who are no longer with us, which has drawn vast audiences from all of the country in order to get a shot at some closure with their departed loved ones. When watching Caputo operate on television, she seems to have an uncanny knack for picking up little tidbits of information that would seem nearly impossible for her to know otherwise. However, behind the scenes, there’s something fishy at play.

        The Personal Side
        Caputo’s show is based on personal connections, but there’s more to her spirit readings than meets the eye. Moreover, her recent fame has taken its toll on her personal life. Theresa may have thought she hit the jackpot when she was offered her own show, Long Island Medium, but given the effect it’s had on her personal life, both Theresa and her husband Larry, may be rethinking how they feel about whether or not the show has changed their lives for the better.

        Eyes On Her
        Theresa Caputo went from a Long Island, New York local to a national star when TLC finally got the go-ahead to produce a show about her psychic abilities. Many networks had passed on the fast-talking New Yorker, but the production company who initially pitched the show found Theresa’s work to be enchanting, despite others cautioning that programming focusing on paranormal activity was waning in popularity. They would soon discover just how wrong they were as the viewers began tuning in.

        Honing Her Skills
        Caputo shared in a 2014 interview with Huffington Post that it took her a long time before she could admit she had the ability to speak to the dead. Theresa was already an adult when she learned that she could channel the inexplicable feelings she had suffered with for so long. She explains that she was guided by a spiritual healer named Pat Longo. As Theresa came to terms with her gifts, she still had to figure out how to tell her husband.

        The Unexplained
        In 2017, Caputo sat down with People magazine to discuss both the success of her show, Long Island Medium, as well as what it was like growing up with supernatural powers. Caputo claims that this connection became apparent at the age of four when she began picking up on the fears of others. She revealed, “If somebody was nervous, I’d pick that up, and my heart would start pounding.” Until her 20s, Caputo just thought she had terrible anxiety, but there was more to the story.

        Pushing The Limits
        Theresa began honing her supposed skills, but to her husband, Larry, she had been just a little nuts from when they first met. “He just thought I was crazy,” Caputo told People.`,

          title: `How That’s So Raven Changed My Life`,
          content: `The other day as I was mindlessly scrolling through Twitter in search of funny memes, I came across a tweet that had me reflecting on the last 17 years of my life. This particular tweet was celebrating that it was the 17th anniversary of That’s So Raven premiering on Disney Channel.
        The first thing I thought? Well fuck, has it really been that long?
        I was just a mere 6 years old in the first grade when That’s So Raven premiered. Now, I am a 23-year-old with a master’s degree in Television Production and Writing, a degree I would not have if it was not for That’s So Raven.
        I, like anyone with a sense of taste, loved That’s So Raven. From Raven’s fashion to her knack for CONSTANTLY getting into sticky situations despite her psychic abilities (or really because of her powers), Raven’s loyalty to her family and friends, and the pure joy that radiated from the screen, That’s So Raven was the highlight of my daily television viewing as a kid. Now with Disney+ I get to relive my childhood and rewatch what I consider to be one of the funniest shows to ever grace Disney Channel.
        Now, when I was a kid, I watched A LOT of television. Like an obscene amount. My days began and ended with me in front of the TV. And this is not to say I didn’t partake in other activities, because I also loved to read and play computer games, but television was my true love.
        I watched so much TV that I began to pick up on A LOT of things, one of them being that there weren’t a lot of Black people on television, and even less shows with a Black lead. Unless I was watching BET, UPN or TV One, the chances of me watching a show featuring a Black protagonist were very slim. Then with kids programming, these numbers were even lower. Because when I look back to the year 2003, the only shows that come to my mind are That’s So Raven, The Proud Family, and Romeo!.
        I loved all three shows, but That’s So Raven was perhaps my favorite. I knew I was going to like That’s So Raven, months before the show even premiered when Disney Channel aired a promo music video featuring the show’s theme song. The moment I saw Raven singing on that fire escape, it was a wrap. I was hooked. When the show finally aired, I was sure to not only get my entire family to watch it with me, but I kept the remote control in my hands to prevent anyone from changing the channel.
        As a young Black girl, That’s So Raven was not just a funny and age-appropriate show for me to watch, it was also one of the few times I got to see people who looked like me and my community shine. Being from the hood in The Bronx, my reality and often the stories I saw on tv, were nothing but pain, poverty, and violence. That’s So Raven became an escape from all of that.
        That’s So Raven literally radiated Black Girl Magic and gave this young black girl a much-needed confidence boost. But the show was much more than an escape from reality and confidence booster for me, it is what inadvertently led me to discover my love for writing.
        As much as I loved the show, I dreaded whenever it went on hiatus. Whether that hiatus was just a couple of weeks or a couple of months. Reruns of previous episodes did not cut it for me. I needed more, and I needed more soon.
        One day during the spring of 3rd grade, I read an article about a 13-year-old girl who loved to read and decided to write her own book, a book that would go on to be a bestseller. Up until then, I never saw writing as something I could do in my free time outside of school. The more I pondered on it, the more I reflected on my imagination. I had all these ideas for possible episodes of That’s So Raven, so I thought, why not write it down?
        I soon found myself writing what would be my very first script. Although I should use the term “script” very loosely here, as I was only 8 years old and I had never seen a script before in my life. What I had written was much closer to that of the narrative style in books, because that was what I was most familiar with.
        I would go on to write several pieces of what I now know is fanfiction, and boy were my stories atrocious. But the quality of my work didn’t matter to me, because I was having fun. Seeing my ideas in front of me, filled me with a sense of joy I had never experienced before and I couldn’t stop.
        The more I stories wrote, the more I began to appreciate the medium. Writing gave me the ability to express myself and my ideas in a way I never did before. As a kid who spent most of her time indoors alone, and when actually out in the world was pretty shy, writing gave me a voice.
        Eventually, when the show came back on the air, I didn’t feel the need to write any more of my scripts/fanfiction, but I didn’t want to stop writing. I shifted gears from fanfiction and began writing my own original stories.
        Over the years I would grow as a writer, learning various formats and strengthening my ability to convey a story. For a while, I stayed away from writing scripts and had envisioned becoming a novelist, but it never felt right. Whenever I wrote, my imagination would run wild and I could envision each story as a show. When I read books, I would immediately picture the words coming to life on screen.
        I couldn’t shake off how much I loved television, and how much it meant to me. By the time I was 14, I knew I wanted to work in television in some capacity, but it would just take a few more years for me to fully decided that I wanted to be a television writer.
        This decision wasn’t solely the result of my love for writing and television but it was also driven by the idea of creating something meaningful for a new generation. I was fueled by the need to create something that would have as much of an impact on a young viewer as That’s So Raven had on me.
        With the knowledge that I now have about the television industry, socialization, and implicit bias, it’s crucial that people of all communities, but mainly those from marginalized communities not only have positive representation on television but multifaceted representation. In That’s So Raven, we had a teenage girl from San Francisco who had psychic powers, loved fashion, boy bands and was always willing to go above and beyond to help her family and friends. Raven Baxter was (and still is with Raven’s Home, the That’s So Raven spinoff) a perfect example of a multifaceted character.`,
